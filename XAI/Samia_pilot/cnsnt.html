          Project Title: Understanding Computer Explanations

          </br>
          </br>
          Introduction</b>
          </br>
          You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by a research team from Texas
          A&M University. The information in this form is provided to help you decide whether or not to
          take part. If you decide you do not want to participate, there will be no penalty to you, and you
          will not lose any benefits you normally would have.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Why Is This Study Being Done?</b>
          </br>
          The purpose of this study is to study the understanding of users of a simple computer system’s accuracy.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Why Am I Being Asked To Be In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          Participants are needed to help us help us better understand how the explanations of a computer system helps users to interpret the system's accuracy. You are being asked to be in this study because you expressed interest in participation.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>How Many People Will Be Asked To Be In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          Up to 150 people may be contacted about participating.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>What Are the Alternatives to being in this study?</b>
          </br>
          The alternative to being in the study is not to participate.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>What Will I Be Asked To Do In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          Each participant will be given a set of animal images. Each image will be associated with another explanatory image. These explanatory images will be provided by a simple computer system. Each participant will view such a set of images and the associated explanations at the 1st step of the study. At the 2nd step of the study, participants will view another set of images, this time they have to answer the question "If the computer system will be able to explain this image or not?” The participant has to answer this question by giving input to system which will be either yes or no.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Are There Any Risks To Me?</b>
          </br>
          The risks associated with this study are minimal, and are not greater than risks ordinarily
          encountered with daily computer use. You do not have to answer anything you do not want to,
          and you can stop at any time without penalty. We are using audio and video recording to study
          how you use the software; this data will not be shared outside of the research team, and it will be
          destroyed when the research project is concluded. The recorded results of your use with the
          software during the analysis activity will be saved and made publicly available online, but this
          data will not include any of your personal information. No photos, audio recordings, or video
          recordings of you will be shared.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Will There Be Any Costs To Me?</b></br>
          Aside from your time; there are no costs for taking part in the study.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Will I Be Paid To Be In This Study?</b>
          Participation is voluntary and no compensation will be given.
          </br></br>
          <b>Who will know about my participation in this research study?</b></br>
          Information about you will be kept confidential and not shared with others. Only the approved
          members of the research team will have access to the information collected during your
          participation. In addition, representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human
          Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&M University Human Subjects
          Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and
          that information is collected and secured properly.

          </br></br>
